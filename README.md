__What's this?__

A simple repo I made to update Custodes to 10e

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yes! The files should be downloadable directly through github

Data Url:
https://github.com/th3proj3ct/wh40k-apocalypse-9e/releases/download/v1.0/index.bsi

On PC you go Manage Data (three rectangles) -> Import Data -> Import Data from URL -> use our data URL.

On Mobile go Manage Data (three rectangles) -> 3 dots -> Add data index url -> use our data URL.
